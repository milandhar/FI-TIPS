- Arrays, linked lists are linear (form a sequence)
- Trees, graphs are non-linear ()

Stacks and queues are two more linear data structures


#Stacks
- Like washing a stack of plates - can only wash the one on top. Last in first out (LIFO)
- Stack uses 'top' (ex. this.top) 


#Queue
- Elements get added to back of the line, removed from front
- Like a line, First in first out(FIFO)
